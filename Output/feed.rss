Smart assistants can generate content quickly, sometimes replacing parts of the writing process. But I still insist on writing with my own thoughts and experiences.</p><p>Not because I don't recognize AI's power, but because I believe: <strong>Only by using my own voice can I truly reach the heart and connect with others.</strong></p><p>This blog is a record of my continuous journey of discovery, and a space where I thoughtfully share more of my unique stories and heartfelt insights.</p><p>I welcome you to join me on this path.</p><p>â€” Kane</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
